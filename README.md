### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. All of the material I needed to complete the assignment was reviewed or offered through the codepath website.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would make the website prettier. Vanilla CSS is, unfortunatly, quite annoying. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Connecting to the API was, for the most part, smooth sailing. Handling and debugging the CSS-- not so much! 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I want to give a shout out to Roy the TA for helping me out with the CSS.
