## Monorepo for all of my fullstack web development projects (Summer 2022)
This repository serves as a single source of entry for every Postgres, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS project I built during my 2022 Summer internship with [Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/) 

Each project functions as a stand alone web application. During the internship, the backend was deployed with heroku and the frontend with surge. 

All projects were amalgamated using Git Subtrees, maintaining a relative and organized structure to the overall commit history.
