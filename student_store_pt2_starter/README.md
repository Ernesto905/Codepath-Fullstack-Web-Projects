# SQL Student Store

For this lab, interns will be expanding on the Week 2 Student Store Assignment.

This time around, we'll design a backend that uses a PostgreSQL database to persist data. Users will need to be logged in to checkout and will be able to see any previous purchases they've made at the student store.
