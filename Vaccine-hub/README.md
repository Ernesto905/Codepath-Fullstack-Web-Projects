# Vaccine Registration Hub Lab

For this lab, interns will be building the backend for a Vaccine Registration platform. The purpose is to allow users to register for a vaccine with their credentials, as well as be able to login and check their appointment info.

Your job is to create a Node, Express, and PostgreSQL powered API that implements registration and login functionality. All data should be persisted to the PostgreSQL database and exposed to the user via API endpoints.

First things first, navigate into the UI directory and run `npm install`. The frontend is already setup to communicate with the API on port 3001, so you'll be responsible for creating the backend for this application.
