# Fast Food Feud

A local startup has asked Site interns to help them construct their new product - `Fast Food Feud`! They love the name and even have a tagline they workshopped: `Folks' Favorite Friendly Fuel Finder For Food Facts`. The one thing they don't have is a working application.

Here's what they have to say about their vision for the mini-app:

> Finding healthy food is hard. Sometimes we just settle for what's available. That doesn't mean we shouldn't know what's going into our bodies! **Fast Food Feud** is here to arm the public with all the nutritional facts needed to make informed decisions about fast food consumption.

They've sourced their nutrition data, bootstrapped a React application, and even hired a designer to creat some styles. However, they quickly realized that they didn't know enough React to make this happen, so they've called on Site to fill in the gaps.
